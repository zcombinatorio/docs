title: "Confirm Claim Transaction"
description: "POST /claims/confirm - Submit signed claim transaction to complete token claim"
---

## Overview

Receives a user-signed claim transaction from `/claims/mint`, adds the protocol's mint authority signature, and submits the complete transaction to the Solana blockchain to finalize the token claim.

## Error Responses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="400 - Missing Parameters">
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Missing required fields: signedTransaction and transactionKey"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="400 - Transaction Data Not Found">
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Transaction data not found. Please call /claims/mint first."
    }
    ```

    This occurs when:
    - Invalid or expired `transactionKey`
    - Temporary storage was cleared
    - Transaction was already processed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="400 - Eligibility Changed">
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Claim eligibility has changed. Requested amount exceeds available claim amount."
    }
    ```

    Eligibility was re-validated and the user no longer has enough tokens available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="500 - Transaction Failed">
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Failed to confirm claim"
    }
    ```

    This can occur due to:
    - Network congestion
    - Insufficient funds for transaction fees
    - Invalid transaction signature
    - Blockchain errors
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Process Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Validate Parameters">
Ensures both required fields are provided
</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve Transaction Data">
Fetches stored transaction details using the `transactionKey`
</Step>

<Step title="Re-validate Eligibility">
Performs a security check to ensure claim eligibility hasn't changed
</Step>

<Step title="Deserialize Transaction">
Converts the Base58 signed transaction back to a Solana Transaction object
</Step>

<Step title="Add Protocol Signature">
Signs the transaction with the protocol's keypair (mint authority)
</Step>

<Step title="Submit to Blockchain">
Sends the fully signed transaction to the Solana network
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for Confirmation">
Monitors the transaction until it's confirmed on-chain
</Step>

<Step title="Cleanup">
Removes the temporary transaction data
</Step>
</Steps>

## Security Re-validation

<Warning>
**Important Security Check**: The API re-validates claim eligibility before processing to prevent race conditions where:
- Other users claimed tokens in the meantime
- Inflation periods advanced
- User's eligibility changed for any reason
</Warning>

This prevents users from claiming more than they're entitled to, even if they hold onto signed transactions.

## Rate Limiting

This endpoint is subject to rate limiting:
- **8 requests per IP** per 2-minute window
- Returns HTTP 429 when limit exceeded

## Transaction Lifecycle

The claim transaction follows this lifecycle:

1. **Creation**: `/claims/mint` creates unsigned transaction
2. **Storage**: Transaction data stored temporarily (10min max)
3. **Signing**: User signs transaction with their wallet
4. **Confirmation**: This endpoint adds protocol signature and submits
5. **Cleanup**: Transaction data removed
6. **Finality**: Tokens are permanently transferred to user

## After Successful Claim

Once tokens are successfully claimed:

1. **Verify Balance**: Check user's token account balance
2. **Update UI**: Refresh claim eligibility for next period
3. **Transaction Proof**: Use `transactionSignature` for verification

## Transaction Signature

The returned `transactionSignature` can be used to:
- View the transaction on Solana explorers
- Verify the token claim on-chain
- Provide proof of claim to users

Example Solana Explorer URL:
```
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${transactionSignature}
```

## Integration Notes

<Tip>
Always handle both success and error cases gracefully. Failed claims may be retryable if the issue was network-related rather than eligibility-related.
