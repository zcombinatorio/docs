## How Withdrawal Percentage Works

When a futarchy proposal is launched:

1. The configured percentage of liquidity is withdrawn from the Meteora pool
2. This liquidity seeds the Pass and Fail conditional token AMMs
3. After the proposal finalizes, liquidity is returned to the Meteora pool

<Info>
**Default:** 12%

Higher percentages provide deeper liquidity for futarchy trading but temporarily reduce main pool liquidity.

## Percentage Guidelines

| Percentage | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- |
| 5-10% | Low-impact proposals, smaller pools |
| 10-20% | Standard proposals, balanced approach |
| 20-35% | High-stakes decisions, larger pools |
| 35-50% | Maximum market depth, very large pools |
