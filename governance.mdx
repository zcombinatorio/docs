## Overview

$ZC governance operates through futarchy, a decision-making framework where proposals are evaluated by markets. Unlike traditional governance, Combinator leverages futarchy to optimize across multiple continuous variables simultaneously.

**Core Principle:** Enable data-driven, market-based decision-making for optimal protocol parameter selection and treasury management.

## Governance Structure

### Futarchy-Controlled Treasury

The Combinator treasury is owned and controlled entirely by futarchy governance.

**Treasury Address:** `4Ckm4JKxJr6qZJHhoPnTkeVdV1qEPmt53hfVcFPCb5fU`

All treasury operations—including asset allocation, emissions schedules, and strategic investments—are determined through futarchy that optimizes for protocol success metrics.

## Futarchy for Decision-Making

Combinator uses futarchy to evaluate proposals across continuous parameter spaces, enabling optimization of:

- **Emission rates**: Dynamic token distribution schedules
- **Treasury allocation**: Multi-asset portfolio management
- **Protocol parameters**: Fee structures, market durations, thresholds
- **Strategic initiatives**: Development priorities and resource allocation

**How it works:** Instead of binary yes/no votes, futarchy aggregates information across multiple possible parameter values to identify optimal configurations.

## Participating in Governance

### View & Trade Proposals

Active governance proposals are available at [combinator.trade/zc](https://combinator.trade/zc), where you can trade on proposal outcomes and influence protocol decisions.

### Submit a Proposal

To submit a governance proposal, reach out to the team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/Vf38Mqhxu5) or [Telegram](https://t.me/+Ao05jBnpEE0yZGVh).

## Decision Criteria

**Primary Metric:** Price performance of $ZC token

Futarchy evaluates proposals based on their predicted impact on token price, aligning governance decisions with protocol value creation.

Additional metrics and multi-objective optimization may be incorporated as the governance framework evolves.
