description: 'How $ZC governance operates through futarchy and quantum markets'

## Overview

$ZC governance operates through futarchy, a decision-making framework where proposals are evaluated through Quantum Markets. Unlike traditional governance, Combinator leverages Quantum Markets to optimize across multiple continuous variables simultaneously.

**Core Principle:** Enable data-driven, market-based decision-making for optimal protocol parameter selection and treasury management.

## Governance Structure

### Futarchy-Controlled Treasury

The Combinator treasury is owned and controlled entirely by futarchy governance through quantum markets.

**Treasury Address:** `ErkB6fQtyGj4WPZPABBDGDVzdfGPiMpWtH46X48skTYS`

All treasury operations—including asset allocation, emissions schedules, and strategic investments—are determined through Quantum Markets that optimize for protocol success metrics.

## Quantum Markets for Decision-Making

Combinator uses quantum markets to evaluate proposals across continuous parameter spaces, enabling optimization of:

- **Emission rates**: Dynamic token distribution schedules
- **Treasury allocation**: Multi-asset portfolio management
- **Protocol parameters**: Fee structures, market durations, thresholds
- **Strategic initiatives**: Development priorities and resource allocation

**How it works:** Instead of binary yes/no votes, quantum markets aggregate information across multiple possible parameter values to identify optimal configurations.

## Participating in Governance

### View & Trade Proposals

Active governance proposals are available as Quantum Markets at [zcombinator.io/zc](https://zcombinator.io/zc), where you can trade on proposal outcomes and influence protocol decisions.

### Submit a Proposal

To submit a governance proposal, reach out to the team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/Vf38Mqhxu5) or submit through the governance forum (coming soon).

## Decision Criteria

**Primary Metric:** Price performance of $ZC token

Futarchy markets evaluate proposals based on their predicted impact on token price, aligning governance decisions with protocol value creation.

Additional metrics and multi-objective optimization may be incorporated as the governance framework evolves.
