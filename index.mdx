The [best](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) [token](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) [launches](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf) [reward network growth](https://x.com/chameleon_jeff/status/1862885996846805222) and community with token incentives. Designing tokenomics is hard. They need to be airtight to prevent farming and induce real growth.

Decision markets could aggregate information for optimal incentive allocation in a dynamic and scalable way. But, current futarchy tech is binary.

This means you can't optimize continuous variables like emission rates with existing futarchy.

Combinator is building [quantum markets](/quantum-markets), a mechanism for scaling futarchy, in order to create market-governed incentive systems.
