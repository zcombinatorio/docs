Combinator provides futarchy infrastructure for your project.

Founders can onboard a token, configure futarchy parameters, and start running it in minutes. Once live, the futarchy trades, settles, executes and resets autonomously.

No waitlist, permissionless, use-case flexible, white glove service from the Combinator team if needed.

## What is Futarchy?

Futarchy is a decision-making system that replaces internal guesswork with markets.

A proposer defines a question with multiple options. Each option gets its own market that starts at the spot token price. Traders buy and sell the markets based on what they believe the token will be worth if that option is enacted. The option with the highest price by the end wins. The action executes based on the result.

**Example:** "What should revenue share be?" with options "0%", "5%", "10%", "15%"

Markets aggregate and reveal information better than individuals and political governance. When the Challenger shuttle exploded, stock markets identified Morton Thiokol as the responsible contractor within 13 minutes — while debris was still falling. The government investigation took five months.

Traders have money on the line. Bad predictions lose money. Mispriced options are profit opportunities for anyone who corrects them. This creates constant pressure toward accuracy.
