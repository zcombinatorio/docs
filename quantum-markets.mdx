title: Quantum Markets
description: 'Scaling futarchy to run multiple decision markets simultaneously'
---

Our inspiration for building quantum markets comes from [Alpin Yukseloglu and Sofaine Larbi writing at Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2025/06/quantum-markets), [Proph3t](https://x.com/metaproph3t)'s implementation of [MetaDAO](https://www.metadao.fi), and [Robin Hanson's work on futarchy](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html).

Quantum markets represent an evolution of decision markets, from evaluating 1 proposal to evaluating n proposals simultaneously.

We believe that the near-term best use case for quantum markets is in helping identify optimal emissions for token network growth.

Put simply, the market bets on the most bullish outcome.

Instead of:
- running obscure point programs that inevitably disappoint users
- deciding on a fixed emission rate and fixed % of supply for rewards, effectively preventing flexibility
- forgoing token incentives altogether
- running back-to-back decision markets to try to find the right emission rate

Quantum markets allow for the market to select a wide range of emission rates that optimize for the success of the token network.

These are not separate markets for each option. It is one mechanism, with multiple futures, and optimal selection.

Every token and crypto product interested in bootstrapping their token network would benefit from more efficient allocation of token incentives.
