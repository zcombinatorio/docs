## Executive Summary

\$ZC acts as a **Network Work Token**. It is a license to contribute value to and capture value from the Combinator Quantum Markets infrastructure. The protocol utilizes a novel "Quantum Justice" system where market sentiment determines Staker obligations adherence.

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vault Program ID** | 47rZ1jgK7zU6XAgffAfXkDX1JkiiRi4HRPBytossWR12 |
| **Fixed Staking Period** | 2 Weeks (1,209,600 seconds) |
| **Real Yield Architecture** | Yield is derived from trading fees and slashing. |
| **Slashing Compliance** | Malicious or inactive stakers are slashed via community-driven Quantum Markets |

## The Social Contract: Stake-to-Earn & The Obligation

Staking \$ZC is not a passive income strategy; it is a **paid role** within the ecosystem. By staking, you enter a social contract with the protocol:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The Reward (Yield)" icon="gift">
    Stakers earn a share of all protocol revenue (trading fees) and 100% of assets seized from slashed participants.
  </Card>
  <Card title="The Obligation (The Job)" icon="briefcase">
    To justify this yield, stakers are mandated to actively contribute to the network's vitality.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Staker Obligations include:**

- Regularly proposing high-quality Quantum Markets (for driving token price up and product adoption)
- Actively trading in good faith across live markets (to deepen liquidity and reveal correct decisions)
- Supporting both Combinator and Combinator-affiliated projects running Quantum Markets

<Note>
Obligations are intentionally qualitative, not rigid. How much emphasis a staker places on trading versus proposing markets and the degree of participation will shift based on the protocol's current needs—determined and enforced by the community through the process below.
</Note>

## Policing & Enforcement ("Quantum Justice")

Adherence to this obligation is not measured by rigid code, but by **peer consensus validated via Quantum Markets**. The community polices itself through the following process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accusation">
    Any user can flag a staker who is "slacking" (collecting yield without contributing) or acting maliciously by proposing they be slashed at https://combinator.trade/zc/create.
  </Step>
  <Step title="QM Activation">
    The Combinator Team reviews the proposal and launches a specific Quantum Market (e.g., "How much should we slash Staker [wallet]?").
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Verdict">
    The market actively trades, allowing the community to price the probability and magnitude of the user's guilt based on their on-chain history.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    If the market resolves to a positive slash amount (e.g., "Yes, Slash 20%"), the smart contract automatically seizes that portion of the user's staked position and redistributes it to the remaining compliant stakers as yield.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mathematical Models & Accounting

### The "Rain Gauge" Yield Drip Mechanism

To prevent reward manipulation, yield is not injected instantly. It is "drip-fed" over the 2-week staking window.

**Distribution Formula:**

Every second, the vault releases rewards into the primary pool:

$$
Drip_{sec} = \lfloor \frac{Queued}{Window} \rfloor + \text{remainder\_adjustment}
$$

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Drip Precision" icon="droplet">
    Our model ensures 100% of tokens are distributed. If `Queued % Window != 0`, the remainder is distributed +1 unit per second for the first R seconds of the stream.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Live Share Price" icon="chart-line">
    Since the price updates every second:

    $$
    Price = \frac{TotalAssets + MaturedRewards}{TotalShares}
    $$
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Yield Calculation (Your Share)

Your earning power is strictly pro-rata. There are no complex multipliers.

$$
Earning\_Rate = \frac{UserShares}{TotalShares} \times GlobalRewardRate
$$

### Slashing Mechanics

When a staker is slashed, the value is returned to the compliant pool in two ways:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Active Slash" icon="bolt">
    If an active staker's shares are burned:
    - `TotalShares` decreases
    - `TotalAssets` remains unchanged
    - **Impact**: The share price for every remaining staker jumps instantly

    $$
    \Delta Price = \frac{TotalAssets}{TotalShares_{new}} - \frac{TotalAssets}{TotalShares_{old}}
    $$
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unbonding Slash" icon="clock">
    If a user is slashed while in the unbonding period:
    - Their tokens move instantly from `reserved_assets` → `total_assets`
    - **Impact**: This creates a step-function jump in share price for all active stakers—not a slow drip
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Vault Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Entry (Staking) - 2 week period">
    Users deposit \$ZC and are minted \$sZC (shares) based on the current price. Yield dripping is active. **Unstaking is disabled**.

    Standard "Funding Mode" allows unlimited deposits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unbonding (Unstaking Request)">
    Further \$ZC deposits are disabled. Yield dripping is stopped. **Unstaking requests are enabled**. Slashed funds are instantly distributed to remaining Stakers.

    **Unstaking requests are for 100% of your position**—partial unstaking is not supported. 

    Requesting an exit initiates a **1-day (24 hour) unbonding timer**. 
    
    Unbonding tokens move from `total_assets` to `reserved_assets` and **yield accumulation stops instantly**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Exit (Withdrawal)">
    **After exactly 24 hours**, the `complete_unstake` function becomes available to the Staker.

    Staker withdraws their principal + all yield accrued up until the moment of their Unstaking Request and are freed of their Staker's Obligation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Stakers can be slashed at any time between staking and completely unstaking their position—including during the unbonding period.
</Warning>

## Looking Ahead

This is the first iteration of the Staking Vault and \$ZC work tokenomics. Expect future iterations as the protocol evolves. All feedback is welcome.
