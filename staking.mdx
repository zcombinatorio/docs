title: "ZC Staking"
---

Stake \$ZC, trade decision markets, earn a share of protocol revenue. 100% of protocol fees go to buying back \$ZC and distributing it to active stakers.

Decision markets running on \$ZC determine how treasury revenue is distributed and how token emissions are allocated to incentivize growth. Active proposals are at [combinator.trade/zc](https://combinator.trade/zc).

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Volume Window** | 14 days |
| **Daily Reward Cap** | Staked Amount / 7 |
| **Lifetime Cap** | Staked Amount |
| **Unstaking Period** | 7 days |
| **Distribution** | Daily |

## How Rewards Work

Your reward each day is based on your share of trading volume over the past 14 days:

$$
\text{reward} = \min\!\left(\text{fee\_wallet\_balance} \times \frac{\text{your\_volume}}{\text{total\_volume}},\;\frac{\text{staked\_amount}}{7}\right)
$$

Two caps limit your earnings:

- **Daily cap** — staked amount / 7 per distribution. Stake 700 ZC = max 100 ZC/day.
- **Lifetime cap** — cumulative rewards can't exceed your staked amount. Compound to raise it.

## Staking Operations

**Stake** — deposit \$ZC into the vault. Your staked amount determines your reward caps.

**Compound** — click "Earned (ZC)" to roll rewards back into your stake. This raises both caps. Don't let rewards sit at the lifetime cap or you stop earning.

**Unstake** — initiate a withdrawal. Starts a 7-day waiting period. That amount stops earning immediately. You can only have one pending unstake at a time. Cannot be cancelled.

**Withdraw** — after 7 days, come back and complete the withdrawal.

**Delegation** — link separate trading wallets to your staking position so volume from those wallets counts toward your rewards. Contact the team via [Telegram](https://t.me/+Ao05jBnpEE0yZGVh) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Vf38Mqhxu5) to set this up.

## Slashing

Staking is an active role. Stakers are expected to trade decision markets in good faith. Bad faith actors can be slashed by the community through a futarchy proposal.

1. Any user flags a staker at [combinator.trade/zc/create](https://combinator.trade/zc/create)
2. The team reviews and launches a slashing futarchy (e.g., "How much should we slash Staker [wallet]?")
3. The market trades and resolves
4. If the result is a positive slash amount, that portion is seized and redistributed to active stakers

Stakers can be tracked at [combinator.trade/zc/stake](https://combinator.trade/zc/stake). Slashing applies during the unstaking period too.

<Note>
Low activity isn't slashable — you just earn less. Slashing is for bad faith actors gaming the system.
