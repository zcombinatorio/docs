title: The Problem
description: 'Why token emissions are hard to get right'
---

The most successful token networks allocate significant supply toward incentives, growth, and community building.

But designing these systems is hard. Emission rates are guesses. Fixed rewards get farmed. Manual distribution doesn't scale.

Builders end up spending time on tokenomics decisions instead of product. They block sybils, tune reward algorithms, and try to figure out if their emission rate is too high or too low. Most get it wrong.

Point programs defer the problem but don't solve it. Eventually points convert to tokens, and the same questions remain.

Decision markets could help. Markets aggregate information. Traders with skin in the game bet against unproductive emissions and for emissions that drive real growth.

But current decision market infrastructure only handles binary questions — one proposal at a time. Finding the optimal emission rate would require dozens of sequential markets.

Quantum markets solve this. One market, multiple possible rates, optimal selection.

**Combinator brings quantum markets to token networks.**
