description: 'Understanding the challenges in token emissions and incentive programs'
---

The most successful token networks reserve a large portion of their token supply for incentives, growth, development, validators, and community building.

But it's unclear how large the incentives need to be and what inflation or emission rate is needed to bootstrap a vibrant token network. Demands change over time, farmers try to extract community rewards, DAOs politic.

A significant number of pre-token teams launch point programs in order to retain as much optionality as possible during product development.

Decision markets could predict optimal rates to grow token price. However, current infrastructure on decision markets doesn't scale.

Current decision market tech allows you to ask a market:
- Will my token price go up if I mint 2M tokens for marketing?

But if the optimal emission rate is 3M / day or 1.5M / day, there is no way of knowing that without quantum markets.

**Combinator will bring quantum markets to all tokens.**
