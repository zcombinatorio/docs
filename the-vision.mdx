description: 'Our vision for the future of token networks'

Every token will have token emissions directed at network growth activities.

Markets will optimize and automate network growth for builders.

Builders can focus on building.

Launching a token supercharges product growth.

The infrastructure becomes invisible and highly autonomous.

**Tokenomics will be a solved problem.**
